Client side:
Direct connection from serveri updating of data through smth tunnel

user sends a post/get request updating the sql database, this then updates the internal, pushing it to everyone including the sender

Server backend >> pushing new messages >> clients JS updates >> text >> holder of css

client sends POST >> serves cleanes response >> validates it >> check it (lots of security >> reciver gets >1> sends to all clients
                                                                                                           >2> updates sql incase of discconect

On connect >> validate >> check if dissconnect >> then go to sevre backend to get sql update (this needs for thought)


Wheres the dopamine you say?
Leader boards and point system of trust (like karma on reddit) YESSS
more points or "Trustoes" you get the more "Higher classed" people you can talk to
talk to the devs,
"Ears offline"
- The higher your level of trust, the more tokens someone pays to talk wth u
- tokens are £1 for 100
- Level 1 trust = 5 tokens
- Level 2 trust = 10
- Level 3 trust = 20
- Level 4 trust = 40
- level 5 trust (max) = 75

now what do they get out of talking to someone?
What about, the longer you are on a chat, the more tokens you generate
- "earns offline"
- Cash out 1K tokens for £5 amazon gift (fake)      | maybe real or smth else. Its how we convey trust
| afk page that is covered in ads



feed it into ai data centers? selling.

needs a insentive. <<<

premuim tokens?  Where there are normal peasant tokens that are free and can be exchanged for talking tokens

Ad points.
Watch ads get points?  -Could be faked

===================================================================== (love how diffent we do things tbf LOL)
Frankies:
- Nice welcome screen with nice animations and "floating" text.
- A connect button
- Randomly connects you with someone using the platform,
- You have 1 muinet to chat!
- A censor word list: e.g. "Snap", "Snapchat", "Pic", "Nude", "D1zzy" etc.
- A report button, that blocks future connections wth that person and reports a transcript to us to moderate
- An account is required wth email signup
- Apon signup, 3 free tokens are given (1 chat = 1 token)               | gambling?
- Buy 10 tokens for 50p (each token is 5p)
-




Both: (semi final ideas)

- When on a chat, depending on the chat level, u generate coins. You level up every 20s then 1m then 5m etc
- You can use the coins to cash out REAL rewards. ( Make really hard: e.g. 1M coins - £2)

--Ads
-Loading between people
-Reward ads for coins
-Banner ads at bottom and top.
-Toggleable ads (reduecs coin generation)
-No more adds (£2.99)
-Ad packs, redeem coins but then watch more ads then usally,   EG: 1 ad normall 20 coints, earn 200 now but watch 15 ads later)
-"watch an ad for 10 coins" then 20, then 40 etc
